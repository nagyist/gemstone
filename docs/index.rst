Welcome to gemstone's documentation!
====================================


The **gemstone** library aims to provide an easy way to
develop simple, understandable and scalable HTTP APIs by using
the asynchronous features of Python by using `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`_ .

This library offers support for writing a microservice that:

- exposes a public Json RPC 2.0 HTTP API (see `The JSON RPC 2.0 specifications <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ )
- can protect API access based on API token identification.
- can communicate with other microservices through the JSON RPC protocol.
